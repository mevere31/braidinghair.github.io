            <h2> Apparently,  Dangerous Chemicals</h2>
            <p> According to a study done by Consumer Report, 100% of the  synthetic braiding hair brands tested
                contain dangerous chemicals such as mosacrylic and vinyl chloride with known links to adverse health effects. 
                Many women around the world wear these synthetic hair blends to create an array of beautiful looks and are popular for vacations and protective styles. Instead of using more expensive human hair extensions, synthetic hair brands are popular for their lower cost and ease of access. 
                In the U.S., the market for these products was valued at $2.79 billion in 2023, and is expected to reach a value of $6.34 billion in 2029. </p> 
            <p> High usage of these products put black women's health at risk. When used in protective styling, synthetic hair/braids are typically worn for about four to six weeks.
                    Such long-term exposure to the heavy metals and volatile organic compounds found in these braiding hair brands could put so many women's health at risk.
                Luckily, Consumer Report scienists tested ten of the most popular synthetic braiding hair products and their findings can be seen below.  </P>
